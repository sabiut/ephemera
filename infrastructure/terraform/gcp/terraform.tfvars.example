# Cloud SQL Configuration

# Memorystore (Redis) Configuration

# Cost Optimization Notes:
# - e2-small nodes: ~$0.03/hour = ~$22/month per node
# - db-f1-micro: Free tier eligible (up to 1 instance)
# - Preemptible nodes: Save up to 80% on compute costs
# - BASIC Redis tier: Single node, cheaper than STANDARD_HA
# - us-central1 region: One of the cheapest GCP regions
#
# Estimated monthly cost (1 node, preemptible):
# - GKE nodes (1 x e2-small preemptible): ~$5/month
# - Cloud SQL (db-f1-micro): FREE (free tier)
# - Memorystore (1GB BASIC): ~$26/month
# - Networking: ~$5/month
# Total: ~$36/month
#
# For testing (4 hours):
# - GKE: ~$0.01
# - Cloud SQL: FREE
# - Memorystore: ~$0.15
# - Networking: ~$0.01
# Total: ~$0.17 for 4-hour test
